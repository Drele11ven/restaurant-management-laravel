# Restaurant Management System (Laravel) 🍽️

A simple Laravel-based application for managing multiple restaurants — designed as a test of a marketplace-like structure. Each restaurant can manage its own menus, orders, and settings independently.

---

## 🧩 Overview

This project is a multi-restaurant management system that demonstrates the structure of a marketplace platform in Laravel. It includes features for creating and managing different restaurants, each with its own:

- Menus

- Categories

- Dishes

- Orders

- Profiles

The goal is to create a scalable structure suitable for food delivery services, restaurant aggregators, or SaaS models for restaurant software.
